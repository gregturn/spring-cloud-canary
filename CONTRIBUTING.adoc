= Contributing to Spring Cloud Canary

Spring Cloud Canary is released under the Apache 2.0 license. If you would like to contribute
something, or simply want to hack on the code this document should help you get started.

== Code of Conduct
This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant link:CODE_OF_CONDUCT.adoc[code of
conduct]. By participating, you  are expected to uphold this code. Please report
unacceptable behavior to spring-code-of-conduct@pivotal.io.

== Using github issues
We use github issues to track bugs and enhancements. If you have a general usage question
please ask on http://stackoverflow.com[Stack Overflow]. The Sprig Cloud team and the
broader community monitor the http://stackoverflow.com/tags/spring-cloud[`spring-cloud`]
tag.

If you are reporting a bug, please help to speed up problem diagnosis by providing as much
information as possible. Submitting a github-hosted sample project replicating the problem helps.

== Sign the Contributor License Agreement
Before we accept a non-trivial patch or pull request we will need you to sign the
https://support.springsource.com/spring_committer_signup[contributor's agreement].
Signing the contributor's agreement does not grant anyone commit rights to the main
repository, but it does mean that we can accept your contributions, and you will get an
author credit if we do.  Active contributors might be asked to join the core team, and
given the ability to merge pull requests. Use '`Phillip Webb`' or '`Dave Syer`' in the
project lead field when you complete the form.

== Code Conventions and Housekeeping
None of these are essential for a pull request, but they help.  They can also be
added after the original pull request but before a merge.

* Use the Spring Framework code format conventions.
* Make sure all new `.java` files to have a simple Javadoc class comment with at least an
  `@author` tag identifying you, and preferably at least a paragraph on what the class is
  for.
* Add the ASF license header comment to all new `.java` files (copy from existing files
  in the project)
* Add yourself as an `@author` to the `.java` files that you modify substantially (more
  than cosmetic changes).
* Add some Javadocs.
* A few unit tests would help a lot as well -- someone has to do it.
* If no-one else is using your branch, please rebase it against the current master (or
  other target branch in the main project).
* When writing a commit message please follow http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html[these conventions].
